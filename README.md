#Getting Started
The primary purpose of the SDK is to allow developers to embed in-app chat messaging in iOS applications.

<a id="requirements"></a> 
## Requirements
This SDK is compatible with applications running on devices with iOS 7.0 or higher.

<a id="sdkintegration"></a> 
## SDK Integration
### Download SDK
1. Manual 
    * Download [PepperTalk.embeddedframework](https://github.com/Espreccino/PepperTalkSDK-iOS/tree/master/PepperTalk.embeddedframework) framework and [Dependencies Resources](https://github.com/Espreccino/PepperTalkSDK-iOS/tree/master/Dependencies%20Resources) folder from github
    * Move the content into your project directory. We usually put 3rd-party code into a subdirectory named `Vendor`
  
2. Cocoapods
    * If Cocoapods not installed, refer [Cocoapods Guide](http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#installation) to install Cocoapods
    * Add "pod PepperTalkSDK-iOS" to your podfile
    * Run pod install
  
### Xcode Setup (Skip this step if using CocoaPods)

1. Drag & drop `PepperTalk.embeddedframework` from your project directory to your Xcode project.

2. Similar to above, our projects have a group `Vendor`, so we drop it there.

3. Select `Create groups for any added folders` and set the checkmark for your target. Then click `Finish`.

4. Select your project in the `Project Navigator` (âŒ˜+1).

5. Select your app target.

6. Select the tab `Build Phases`.

7. Expand `Link Binary With Libraries`.

8. Add the following system frameworks, if they are missing:
    - `Accelerate`
    - `AssetsLibrary`
    - `CoreData`
    - `CoreGraphics`
    - `CoreImage`
    - `CoreLocation`
    - `Foundation`
    - `ImageIO`
    - `MapKit`
    - `MessageUI`
    - `MobileCoreServices`
    - `QuartzCore`
    - `Security`
    - `SystemConfiguration`
    - `UIKit`

9. Add the following libraries, if they are missing:
    - `libicucore.dylib`

10. Select the tab `Build Settings`.

11. Add -ObjC to Build Settings->Other Linker Flags if already not present

### Generate ClientID and Client Secret
Generate Client ID & Client Secret to authenticate your application with PepperTalk. Follow these steps to generate Client ID & Client Secret:
* Go to [PepperTalk Console](https://console.getpeppertalk.com/dashboard/signup)
* Fill in the details and signup
* Validate your email address by clicking on the link you get in your email inbox
* Create a new application by selecting the "New Application" option from the menu on left hand side
* Enter the Application Description
* Optionally, select and enter push notification related information to support remote OS notifications
* Find Client ID & Client Secret in the 'Clients' tab on your application page

### Modify Code 

#### Objective-C
1. Open your `AppDelegate.m` file.

2. Add the following line at the top of the file below your own #import statements:

        #import <PepperTalk/PepperTalkSDK.h>

3. Search for the method `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`

4. Add the following lines to setup PepperTalk:

        [PepperTalk sharedInstance].clientId = @"YOUR_CLIENT_ID";
        [PepperTalk sharedInstance].clientSecret = @"YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET";
        [[PepperTalk sharedInstance] enableInAppNotificationsInViewController:self.window.rootViewController]; //To enable in-app notifications

5. To enable Remote Notifications
    * Enable remote notifications as described in [Apple Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/Chapters/IPhoneOSClientImp.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008194-CH103-SW2)
    * Search for method `application:didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken`
    * Add following line of code
      * `[PepperTalk sharedInstance].deviceToken = deviceToken;`
    * Search for method `application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:`
    * Add following line of code
      * `[[PepperTalk sharedInstance] handleRemoteNotification:userInfo presentingViewController:self.window.rootViewController];`

6. Starting with iOS 8, to enable location sharing in PepperTalk, you must set a string for the key `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` or `NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription` in your app's Info.plist file. For more information refer [Apple Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CocoaKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009251-SW18). If neither of the keys are found in the client's Info.plist file, then the location sharing opiton will not be available.

#SDK Documentation

<a id="glossary"></a> 
##Glossary
* Current Logged In User  
A user can become current logged in user in PepperTalk. Any outgoing chat message will be sent on behalf of this user.
* Topics  
Pepper Talk exposes a topic for having multiple threads of conversations with the same user. A topic id can be any string that you choose. For example a listing app could use the id of the listing as the topic id. This would help the app to organize the chats among the same set of participants with a logical entity in the app. A topic title is also supported to give a descriptive value for the topic id.

<a id="authentication"></a> 
##Authentication
###Client Authentication
PepperTalk authenticates client apps. Client Authentication is done by setting the ClientId & Client Secret. A client app cannot use PepperTalk SDK without correct ClientID and Client Secret.

####Related API
	/** Pass clientId to identify the client app */
	@property (nonatomic, copy) NSString *clientId;

	/** Pass clientSecret to authorize the client app to use PepperTalk SDK*/
	@property (nonatomic, copy) NSString *clientSecret;
####Code Snippet
	PepperTalk *pepperTalkInstance = [PepperTalk sharedInstance];
    pepperTalkInstance.clientId = @"CLIENT_ID";
    pepperTalkInstance.clientSecret = @"CLIENT_SECRET";

###User Authentication
PepperTalk does not authenticate users. Since we only accept requests from authenticated client app, Login/Signup request for any user from the client app is assumed to be authorized and for an authenticated user.  

A user become current logged in user in PepperTalk by providing few details such as username & profile information. Once these details are provided PepperTalk will remember the current logged in user forever and will only log the user our of PepperTalk when explicitly asked to do so.

Profile Information is optional & can be updated later on.

##Photo and Location Sharing Via Chat
Photo & Location sharing is supported by PepperTalk out of box.
###Photo Sharing
PepperTalk will request permission to access Photos app. If permission is denied then photo sharing from Photos app wont be available.

###Location Sharing
Starting with iOS 8, to enable location sharing in PepperTalk, you must set a string for the key `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` or `NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription` in your app's Info.plist file. For more information refer [Apple Documentation on Location Keys](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CocoaKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009251-SW18). If neither of the keys are found in the client's Info.plist file, then the location sharing opiton will not be available
